Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line with 6 places after the decimal.

Example

arr = [1, 1, 0, -1, -1]
There are elements, two positive, two negative and one zero. Their ratios are:
 - 2/5 = 0.400000
 - 2/5 = 0.400000
 - 1/5 = 0.200000

. Results are printed as:

0.400000
0.400000
0.200000

Sample Input


6              
-4 3 -9 0 4 1

Sample Output

0.500000
0.333333
0.166667
